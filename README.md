# Webdev Notes

A list of tools and services related to web development that i have found useful or just wanted to remember for later.

<small>Should you be reading this on GitHub please visit the [Webdev Notes website](https://webdev-notes.netlify.com/#/) for an improved reading experience</small>

## Why???

**Why the hell would you build this?**

Good question :)

Mainly I wanted a place to keep track of all the great services, tools and other things I stumble across. Like a "Favorite and forget" type of things. But nice and searchable. That somehow ran of and became a website because websites is what I do.

I will be super happy if this is of use to you.

## How?

This website is the result of a GitHub Repository containing Markdown files.

Obviously presented in a nice format using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/).
