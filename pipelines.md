# Pipeline tools

What you commonly call CI/CD tools is presented here.

I decided against that term however since it is quite overloaded with meaning. For one CD simultaneously stands for "Continuous Delivery" as well as "Continuous Deployment" and those are two very different things indeed.

And most of these tools are really just glorified Gulp style task runners in the cloud with a few bubbles to represent done tasks.

## Travis CI

## Circle CI

## Drone IO

## GoCD

The notion that one should have multiple pipelines behind one another to really visualize workflows.

## Jenkins

Personally don't like the thing or Groovy for that matter but wiedely popular.
