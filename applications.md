# Applications

What would a developer be without his applications that help them to navigate daily tasks easily.

## Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is Microsofts Code Editor. And it is marvelous!

My favorite editor at the moment with awesome Git integration and tons of plugins provided by the community to help you get your work done.

## Atom

Comparable to Visual Studio Code but I simple like VS Code better at the moment.

## Brackets

Another great Editor for webdevs. It especially shines through it's tight integration with page reloading. If your focus is styling work this might be your best choice.

Also has great integration with Adobe products.

## Mark Text

[Mark Text](https://marktext.github.io/website/) is an awesome, minimal Markdown editor.

## BlankUp

[BlankUp](https://hoverbaum.github.io/BlankUp-Electron/) is my self written Markdown editor utilizing Electron to bring you a cross platform editing experience. Sadly Mark Text is probably better for general Markdown editing.
