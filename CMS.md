# CMS solutions

CMS solutions drive the webs content. They enable content managers to make lightning fast changes to their products and drive companies to stay competitive in the market. They also enable non-technical users to run Blogs and Websites without any knowledge of web technologies.

## Contentful

Contentful is one of the driving forces behind an API-first CMS movement. As such they provide a clean API to retrieve content from instead of rendering the pages themselves. This is great for developers who can have a single point to get information from and get going with customizing the display of said data.

Not so great for non-techy users as there are no "templates" or "themes" and systems to generate the website itself.

- API first
- Can be cost intensive

## Wordpress

A tool for some jobs but not for all. Personally, like many developers, I do not appreciate Wordpress. As a tool it simply doesn't enable developers to make fast customization changes without a considerable up-front effort. Wordpress however does work great for people just wanting to start "a website". You don't need much knowledge and you can run Wordpress on any webhost.
